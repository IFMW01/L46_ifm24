# L46_ifm24
L46 Coursework Project

This repository holds all of the scripts used to acquire the data for the plots presented in the L46 project submission for CSRID: Ifm24.

The data is not stored in this repository as it exceeds 10GB in size and, therefore, cannot be stored on GitHub. All of the figures from each of the scripts are included. To navigate to the training script, please enter the architecture folder and see the training script along with the corresponding visualisations for the specific dataset. Each script is identical in structure and was created to allow for computation to be done in parallel in Google Collab. 

Base model and independent model creation are done in the script, along with self-distillation and quantization in the training scripts. The implemented method for L1 pruning is held in the pruning folder, which contains the code to perform L1 pruning.
